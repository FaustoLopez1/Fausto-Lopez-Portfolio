## Description
![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Description-green)

- As a new web devoloper, I wanted to so as much as i could do with my current knowledge. I'm still learning and will
continue to do my best

- I wanted a codebase that was a little more above the criteria

- My site is optimized for search engines and quick links to my current projects

- I learned that making certain elements are indicators for me and others to understand my code.

## Usage
